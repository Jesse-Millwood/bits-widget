* Bits Widget

This is a small widget that provides a widget interface in Emacs to fiddle with
bits. It allows you to:
- Define a number in Hex
- Define a number by interactively setting bits
- Push the number to the kill ring in a variety of formats including:
  - Calc 16#NNNN format
  - Elisp #xNNNN format
  - Regular 0xNNNN
  - Optionally add the "Byte" unit suffix to the pushed number
    - This is useful with the =calc-prog= package
